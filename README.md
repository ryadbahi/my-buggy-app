# Let's start debugging

Once th app Lauched we can see that the name is not set and when the incremnt button click it dosnt increment its adds ones :'(

Let's take a look on our react dev tools 

![{16F67380-5857-4E5D-92E4-696763B8076A}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a2ba826-7be8-490f-af8f-a757bc8b0400)

We can see abouve that at the pros level the name is set to undefined, lets try to passe a string 

![{ACD681E7-FBF7-413D-94C8-89E78BF90994}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/186ed1e0-860c-4c80-8cb3-35b4218d80dc)

Well it seems to be working

![{EB4830BE-6298-40F2-8B06-4F458117F803}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cf947de-a8e2-42ba-b976-8c32fa00b9a6)

So here we can conclud that the value passed isnt right we should fix that, now what about our counter ?

![{1A0B4E03-506F-4A63-8A61-EEB614DC4E4C}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2f1382e-d355-454a-978c-39811f06ed44)

We can can clearly see that the value passed is a string, which is not what we want if we need it to increment on each click, let change the State to test our theory

![{9ED02C71-6F38-4E31-ACBC-B7CF1B8E27AD}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9762288-ca97-4f15-be94-ab670eb5f406)

![{53D82CE4-E92F-4EFA-A5CD-268F46E41E70}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c77b7d9-bf28-4c72-bcfa-1d4562e2a89a)

Well it seems to be just that, now we need to fix that on our code :)
